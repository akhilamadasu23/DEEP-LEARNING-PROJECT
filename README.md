# Image Classification Using Deep Learning and TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning–based image classification system using TensorFlow and Keras. The main goal is to classify images of fruits and vegetables into their respective categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Objectives
- To build an image classification model using CNN.
- To classify fruits and vegetables images accurately.
- To understand deep learning concepts using TensorFlow.
- To improve model performance using data augmentation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images of various fruits and vegetables such as:
- Apple
- Banana
- Orange
- Tomato
- Potato
- Carrot
- And more
- 
## The dataset is divided into:
- Training set:
- During the training phase, the model learns from labeled images using supervised learning techniques. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting were applied to improve the    model’s generalization ability and reduce overfitting. 
- Validation set:
-  The model was trained for multiple epochs, and performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- Testing set:
-  After training, the model was tested on unseen images to verify its classification performance. The trained model is capable of predicting the correct category of fruits and vegetables with high accuracy. This   system can be used in real-world applications such as automated billing systems in supermarkets, smart kitchen applications, and agricultural monitoring systems.
All images are resized and normalized before training.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
## Model Architecture
The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and includes:
- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling Layers
- ReLU Activation
- Fully Connected Dense Layers
- Softmax Output Layer
These layers help in extracting important features from images.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the effective use of deep learning and TensorFlow for image classification tasks. It highlights the importance of CNNs in computer vision and provides a practical implementation for classifying fruits and vegetables. The project can be further enhanced by using larger datasets, advanced architectures, and real-time deployment using web or mobile applications.
